# EM Pulse Sequence Generator

This project implements a **pulse sequence algorithm** for Electro-Magnetic (EM) dimming, designed for display driver systems that require smooth and flicker-free brightness control.  

Instead of dimming linearly, the algorithm generates **deterministic, balanced pulse sequences** that distribute *off-time* evenly. This ensures early pulses reduce first while maintaining uniformity across the sequence. Flicker metrics (max/avg deviation) are also computed to evaluate stability.  

Results can be exported to Excel (`.xlsx`) using **OpenPyXL**, with color-coded formatting for easy visualization and validation.

## âœ¨ Features
- Generates deterministic dimming pulse sequences for **1â€“64 pulses**  
- Outputs Excel diagrams (`.xlsx`) with clear, color-coded formatting  
- Reports **flicker metrics** (maximum and average deviation)  
- Lightweight Python script with no external dependencies beyond OpenPyXL
